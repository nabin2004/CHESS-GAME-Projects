# If I want to do with complete python:
## These are some question's answer that I have while beginning

Choose a Python Web Framework:

Consider using frameworks like Django, Flask, or FastAPI for your back-end development.

    Django is a comprehensive framework that provides built-in features for user authentication, database integration, and more.
    Flask is a lightweight framework that allows for flexibility and customization.
    FastAPI is a modern, high-performance framework that can handle real-time communication efficiently.

Design the Database:

Determine the database schema for storing user account information, game rooms, and game moves.

    You can use relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL, or NoSQL databases like MongoDB, depending on your needs.

Develop User Authentication:

Implement user signup and login functionality to handle user account creation and authentication.

    Use secure password hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2 for storing user passwords.
    Utilize libraries like Flask-Login or Django's built-in authentication system to handle user sessions and authentication.

Create the Game Lobby:

Design the front-end interface for users to sign up, create accounts, and create game rooms.

    Implement the necessary back-end APIs to handle room creation, joining, and retrieving available rooms.
    Use a WebSocket library like Flask-SocketIO or Django Channels for real-time communication.

Develop the Chess Game Logic:

Design the game board using either canvas or HTML blocks. You may also use a game engine like Pygame for rendering and interaction.

    Implement the rules of chess, including piece movements, captures, en passant, castling, and pawn promotion.
    Add move validation to ensure that players can only make valid moves according to the chess rules.
    Use the chosen framework or manual DOM manipulation to update the game board UI based on the players' moves.

Handle Multiplayer Functionality:

Establish WebSocket connections between players in the same game room.

    Implement WebSocket event handlers on the server-side to handle player moves, validate them, and update the game state.
    Use the WebSocket library to emit socket events to inform players about the current game state and moves made by opponents.
    Broadcast game state updates to all players in the same room to synchronize the game in real-time.

Implement Chat Functionality:

Integrate a chat feature to allow players in the same room to communicate with each other during the game.

    Use WebSocket connections to transmit chat messages between clients and the server, and broadcast them to the appropriate recipients.

Add Additional Features:

Enhance the game with features such as game timers, move history, offer draw, resign, and other functionalities commonly found in chess games.

Test and Debug:

Thoroughly test the game to ensure all functionalities work as expected.

    Debug any issues that arise during testing.
    Consider implementing unit tests and integration tests to automate the testing process.

Deployment:

Deploy your application to a server or cloud platform of your choice.

    Set up the necessary configurations and ensure that the game can be accessed by multiple players simultaneously.
